{"name":"Metalicious","tagline":"An open-source data dictionary which can be deployed to track the metadata of one or more databases.","body":"Metalicious - Open Source Data Dictionary\r\n=========================================\r\nMetalicious is an open-source, web-based data dictionary that is designed to capture and display metadata from databases, tables, and fields for platforms with one or more databases. Users may customize and deploy Metalicious as an internal or public data dictionary website.\r\n\r\nThis project is a generic release of the City of Chicago's [data dictionary](http://datadictionary.cityofchicago.org).\r\n\r\nInstallation\r\n============\r\nCopy the repository or download a compressed folder and unpack the directory to the folder you wish to host Metalicious.\r\n\r\nImporting Database\r\n------------------\r\nUsing the command line, run the following script:\r\n```bash\r\nmysql -u db-username -p -h yourlocaldatabase < database/Metalicious_DB.sql\r\n```\r\nMetalicious will create a new database called \"datadictionary\". Ensure no database with the same name exists as Metalicious will overwrite pre-existing data.\r\n\r\n\r\nCreating Users\r\n--------------\r\nThere is not a way to enter new users through the website in the current version. Adding new users will require access to the MySQL server and database. Use the following script to add new users:\r\n```sql\r\nINSERT INTO Users\r\n\t(User_Name, Password, First_Name, Last_Name)\r\nVALUES\r\n\t('_username-to-be-added_', '_password_', 'user-first-name', 'user-last-name');\r\n```\r\nWhere the _italicized_ arguments will be inserted into the user account.\r\n\r\nCreating Business Functions\r\n---------------------------\r\n\"Business Functions\" is used to create categories to help users navigate to data dictionary entries. Currently, Metalicious does not support adding business functions through the website. Instead, new functions can be added through the following commands:\r\n```sql\r\nINSERT INTO Business_Functions\r\n\t(Business_Function_Name, Business_Function_Description)\r\nVALUES\r\n\t('_business-function-to-be-added_', '_business-function-description_');\r\n```\r\nThe _italic_ entries may be modified to fit your needs.\r\n\r\nDeploying Website\r\n-----------------\r\nMove the contents of /web to the directory you wish to deploy Metalicious.\r\n\r\nAfter moving the contents, configure /include/dbconnopen.php to the appropriate MySQL database and login information:\r\n```php\r\n$cnnCDD = mysqli_connect(\"_yourlocaldatabase_\", \"_db-username_\", \"_db-password_\")\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe deployment of Metalicious assumes it will be installed in the root directory of the server (e.g., DOCUMENT_ROOT). To change this behavior, modify the file location.php \r\n\r\nEditing Contact Form\r\n--------------------\r\nMetalicious includes a contact form for users to contact a central location. You can edit the contact information in _ajax/contact_send.php_ \r\n```php\r\n$to = \"\\\"_email-name_\\\" <email-address@example.com>\";\r\n$subject = \"Metalicious Data Dictionary: Online Comment / Question / Suggestion\";\r\n```\r\n\r\nAdding Data\r\n===========\r\n\r\nAdding a new system or revising an existing system\r\n-------------------\r\n1.\tLog into website\r\n+\tUsername: beginning of e+mail address (i.e. jsmith – do not include @gmail.com)\r\n+\tPassword: same as username\r\n2.\tOpen an existing database and select “Create new DB” (located at the bottom of the database detail table)\r\n+\tNote: Need to be in an existing database to create a new database\r\n3.\tEnter all relevant information on the system \r\n4.\tSelect “Create New Database” once all information has been entered\r\n+\tNote: This will create the database, but it will not yet appear on the website\r\n5.\tActivate the database \r\n+\tClick on your name at the top of the screen and select “Admin” from the drop down\r\n+\tClick on the database and then select “Activate Revision”\r\n+\tThe system will now appear on the website.  Note: The database will need to be activated in order for it to be complete and appear in the website as well as for you to add the business function.\r\n6.\tAdding the Business Function\r\n+\tUse the “Search” feature to open up the new database\r\n+\tAt the end of the database detail table, select the business function where this database belongs\r\n+\tFollow step 7 to update the revision\r\n7.\tMaking Revisions to a database\r\n+\tClick “Change Info” at the end of the database detail \r\n+\tClick “Save Revisions”\r\n+\tClick “Database Revisions” and click “Load this revision” next to the appropriate dated revision.\r\n\r\n\r\nImporting a table\r\n-----------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nImporting a variable\r\n---------------------\r\n1.\tSteps to take to get file ready for importing\r\n+\tCopy all relevant fields (system, table, column/field, type, length, value range, description, examples, comments) with no header row and paste into a separate excel file and save as CSV (comma delimited) file.\r\n+\tThe System name in the file must match exactly how the system is named in the website.  For example, if the system is titled “Attendance System” in the website, the spreadsheet must have “Attendance System” listed under the system column.  \r\n2.\tLog into website\r\n3.\tSelect “import” from the drop down list under your name \r\n4.\tSelect the “browse” button under the second option - Choose your Variables.csv file and then click on the submit button\r\n5.\tAdd the appropriate variable CSV file\r\n6.\tSelect “submit”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRequirements\r\n============\r\n\r\nMetalicious has not gone through broad deployment testing. Below are the specifications which this project was built. We appreciate feedback on other platforms which Metalicious does and does not operate.\r\n\r\nSystem Requirements\r\n-------------------\r\nSevers hosting this project requires. This project was developed with the following specifications:\r\n+ MySQL Community Server 5.5.25a\r\n+ PHP 5.4.5\r\n\r\nLicense & Support\r\n-----------------\r\n\r\nMetalicious is released under an MIT-style license.
